# FrankaPandaEmikaCoppeliaSim

The default **Franka Emika Panda** model that comes with **CoppeliaSim (formerly V-REP)** is known to suffer from several technical issues that can negatively affect simulation reliability and integration with external toolboxes like MATLAB or DQRobotics. These issues include:

- **Incorrect Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters** in the model's kinematic chain  
- **Inconsistent joint configurations**, such as limits and initial positions  
- **Improper dynamics**, including mass and inertia settings that lead to unrealistic physical behavior  
- **Mismatches between simulation tools**, resulting in incompatibility with MATLAB's Robotics System Toolbox, the DQRobotics interface, and CoppeliaSimâ€™s own API  

If these issues are not addressed, users may experience instability, incorrect robot behavior, or failed simulations â€” especially when integrating with external software for research or robotics development.

## ðŸ›  What This Repository Provides

This repository by [@hwyao](https://github.com/hwyao) offers a **corrected version** of the Panda robot model for CoppeliaSim, along with:

- A fully updated `.ttt` simulation scene and `.ttm` robot model  
- A **test suite** for verifying model consistency across:
  - MATLAB's Robotics System Toolbox  
  - DQRobotics Toolbox  
  - Raw CoppeliaSim Remote API  
- A helper script to set up the environment quickly (`prepareEnvironment.m`)  
- Documentation and usage tips to avoid common API pitfalls  
- Guidance for modifying third-party tools (e.g., making `DQ_VrepInterface.vrep` public)  

These fixes ensure reliable simulation behavior and compatibility with academic and research-grade robotic software environments.
